# Multi Theft Auto Online

Multi Theft Auto Online is a project of mine that aims to keep MTA:SA and possibly older GTA games alive by providing feature rich, scalable servers to the community.


# Planned Features
- Scaling and matchmaking using Kubernetes and Google Agones
- Interconnectability between servers (chat with friends, etc)
- SSO Login (no need to login again and again)

# Gameplay features
- Freemode: Ability to play freely with properties, vehicles and missions.
- Dedicated missions to play with others.

# Support
If you want to contribute or support this project, feel free to reach out to me or create issues and requests. All help is much appreciated!
